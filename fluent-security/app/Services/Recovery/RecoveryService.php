/**
 * What to do once you think somebody has been in.
 *
 * The most dangerous surface this plugin has, and the design follows from that. Every action
 * here either evicts somebody or writes to people's inboxes, and it is reached by a person
 * who has just had a fright - so nothing is offered that cannot be explained in a sentence,
 * nothing is done that the reader was not told about, and everything that happens is written
 * to the auth log with the name of whoever did it.
 *
 * Two mechanisms are deliberately not the obvious ones.
 *
 * Signing everyone out destroys the session tokens rather than rotating the salts in
 * wp-config.php. Both evict every cookie on the site; only one of them involves this plugin
 * rewriting the single file a WordPress install cannot survive being wrong - and the salts
 * are not only used for cookies. Plenty of plugins derive an encryption key from them and
 * keep credentials under it: an SMTP password, a payment gateway's secret. Rotating the
 * salts turns all of those into ciphertext nobody holds the key for, silently, and the site
 * only finds out the next time it tries to send an email or take a payment. There is no
 * outcome the rotation buys here that is worth that, so the salts are left alone and the
 * screen says so.
 *
 * And the person running the recovery stays signed in. Turning them out along with everyone
 * else reads as thorough and helps nobody: an attacker holding an administrator account can
 * do this again whatever we revoke, and the one person who needs to keep working is the one
 * at the keyboard.
