 * One question the plugin knows how to ask about this site.
 *
 * A check runs and returns findings - none, one, or several - and may know how to act on
 * them. Everything else about it is declared rather than inferred, because the screen has
 * to decide what to run before it runs anything.
 *
 * `cost()` is the declaration that matters most. The security screen must not be blank on
 * arrival, and it must not spend a minute of the reader's time proving it. So the checks
 * that answer in microseconds run on every page load with no button, and only the ones that
 * talk to the network or walk the disk wait to be asked. Splitting them by cost rather than
 * by subject is what lets the screen be useful immediately and thorough on request.
