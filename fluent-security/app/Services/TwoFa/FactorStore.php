/**
 * Every second factor a user holds, in one table.
 *
 * A passkey, an authenticator app and a recovery code are three different proofs, but
 * they are the same kind of record: something a user registered, that a login can ask
 * for, that can be spent or revoked, and that somebody eventually has to list. Keeping
 * them apart meant asking two different storage layers the same question and getting
 * answers that could not be combined - the enrollment screen counted authenticator apps
 * and silently ignored passkeys, because one lived in user meta and the other did not.
 *
 * What is shared gets a column; what belongs to one type goes in `meta` as JSON. The
 * split is not by whether a field is common but by whether it ever changes on its own:
 * `counter`, `status` and `last_used_at` are written during a login and must not be
 * part of a blob that a concurrent request could rewrite whole. Everything in `meta` -
 * a passkey's transports, its aaguid - is written once at registration and never again.
 *
 * How each type uses the columns:
 *
 *   passkey   identifier = credential id, secret = public key PEM, counter = signature
 *             counter, meta = algorithm, transports, aaguid, backup flag
 *   totp      identifier = null, secret = the base32 shared secret, counter = the last
 *             time step spent. A setup that was started but never confirmed is the same
 *             row with status `pending`, which is what keeps an abandoned one from
 *             counting as an enrollment
 *   recovery  identifier = the code's hash, one row per code, status `used` once spent
 *
 * Only the authenticator app's secret is ever encrypted, and only when the site has a key
 * for it - see SecretCipher. The passkey column named `secret` holds a *public* key, which
 * is public by definition and has nothing to hide, and a recovery code is a one-way hash.
 * So this is the single seam where encryption happens: secrets are protected on the way
 * into insert() and revealed on the way out of every read, and nothing above this class
 * knows whether the row it is holding came back from ciphertext or not.
 *
 * A secret that cannot be decrypted comes back as an empty string with
 * `secret_unreadable` set on the row, rather than as a hard failure. That is deliberate:
 * an unreadable secret makes isEnrolled() false, which sends the user to re-pair their
 * phone instead of to a code prompt that can never be satisfied. A lost key costs
 * everybody an enrollment; it must never cost anybody their account.
