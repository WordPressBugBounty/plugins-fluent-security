/**
 * The way back in when the second factor cannot be answered.
 *
 * Every account with a second factor has a state where the honest owner is locked out:
 * the phone is lost, the authenticator was never transferred to the new one, the laptop
 * holding the only passkey is at the office, the browser will not do WebAuthn. Sites
 * without an answer to that get a support ticket, and the answer they are usually given
 * over email is "run this SQL" - which is worse than anything written here.
 *
 * So the answer is a constant in wp-config.php, and putting it there is itself the
 * authorisation. Somebody who can edit wp-config.php can already add an administrator,
 * change the database credentials or read the auth salts; a switch that only they can
 * reach gives away nothing they did not already hold. That is the whole security
 * argument, and it is why this can be explained openly on the login screen rather than
 * kept for support staff.
 *
 *     define('FLUENT_AUTH_DISABLE_TWO_FA', 'jane');   // just this account
 *     define('FLUENT_AUTH_DISABLE_TWO_FA', true);     // every account, site wide
 *
 * The named form is what the login screen offers, because it is no harder to paste and
 * it leaves the second factor standing for everybody else while one person gets back in.
