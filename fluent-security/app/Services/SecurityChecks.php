/**
 * The security checklist on the dashboard, and the one-click way to satisfy an item.
 *
 * A check is `done` or `todo`, and separately it is scored or not. Only the protections
 * this plugin recommends for every site count towards the score, so the score is reachable
 * - the rest are shown below it as things to weigh up. What "recommended" means comes from
 * Helper::getRecommendedSettings() rather than from anything written here, so the checklist
 * and the "apply recommended" button cannot disagree.
 *
 * The rule this list is built to obey: nothing on it may scold a site for a configuration
 * somebody chose on purpose. An early version marked sites down for not blocking
 * application passwords - a thing plenty of sites legitimately depend on - and a list that
 * does that teaches people to ignore the list. Which is why a recommendation that does not
 * suit every site either goes unscored, goes in as advice, or does not go on the list at
 * all.
