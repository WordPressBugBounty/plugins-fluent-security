     * - Only an account that cannot publish is let through. `publish_posts` is the same
     *   line Helper::getLowLevelRoles() already draws for the admin-area settings, and it
     *   is what separates a subscriber or a customer from anybody who can change the
     *   site. It matters because the shipped default has email codes on for
     *   administrators, editors and authors and nobody in the required list - so a rule
     *   that read only the required list would hand every default install's
     *   administrator a way past their own second factor.
     *
     * - Somebody who set up an authenticator app or registered a passkey is never let
     *   through. They opted into a second step; the form they happened to use is not a
     *   reason to drop it. holdsEnrolledDevice() rather than hasDeviceFactor() on
     *   purpose - a lone passkey is not asked for at sign-in, but it is still a device
     *   this account chose to register.
     * - Nor is anybody the site *requires* to hold one. That setting is the site saying
     *   the account may not be reached without a second factor, and a login path is not
     *   an exception to it.
     * - Nor is an account under attack. getRequiredMethod() only hands back a method
     *   that is not available to the user when the repeated-failure fallback fired, so
     *   an unavailable method here means the challenge is the escalation rather than the
     *   standing policy - the one case where challenging somebody who enrolled in
     *   nothing is the whole point.
     *
     * What is left is a visitor with no second factor of their own, on a site that does
     * not require one of them, who would have been shown an emailed code. That code is
     * still asked for on every form the plugin can draw a challenge on; this is only
